## 🚀 StageAsset: Product Brief

### **Tagline**

*Stop Chasing Speakers. Start Running Events.*

### **The One-Liner**

StageAsset is a best-in-class, automated hub for collecting bios, slides, and logos from event speakers, eliminating the chaos of email and Google Forms.

### **The Problem (The Pain We Eliminate)**

Every event professional faces the same logistical nightmare in the weeks before an event: **"The Asset Chaos."**

* **For the Event Manager:** A constant, low-grade stress. Digging through endless email threads, sending manual follow-ups, and wrestling with mislabeled files from `FINAL_v2_USE_THIS_ONE.pptx`. It's unprofessional, time-consuming (5-10 hours per event), and creates a single point of failure.
* **For the Speaker:** A frustrating, fragmented experience. They are busy professionals who are doing the event a favor. Being asked to email files into a void feels outdated. They get confused, miss deadlines, and the event manager has to chase them, damaging the relationship before the event even begins.

### **The Solution (The Promise)**

StageAsset provides a single, elegant, and branded portal for your event. We replace the chaos with a seamless, automated workflow.

* **You create an event in 60 seconds** and get a simple link.
* **You send that one link to all your speakers.**
* **Speakers upload their assets** in a beautiful, frictionless portal with no login required.
* **You get a unified dashboard** with all submissions, and automated reminders chase late speakers for you.

**The Core Expectation:** StageAsset isn't just a feature; it's the **last tool you'll ever need for event asset collection.** It must be so reliable and polished that it becomes an invisible, essential part of an event manager's workflow.

## 💰 Pricing Strategy

### **Option A: Subscription Model (Recommended to Start)**

* **Starter ($39/month):** 1 active event, 10 speakers/event, basic features.
* **Professional ($99/month):** 3 active events, 50 speakers/event, branded portal, file validation, priority support. ***(TARGET PLAN)***
* **Agency ($249/month):** Unlimited events, 100 speakers/event, white-label options, API access.

### **Option B: Usage-Based Model (The Anti-Churn Pivot)**

## ⚠️ Key Metrics for Success (The Brutal Honesty Checklist)

* **Activation Rate:** >80% of event managers who create an event must successfully send the link to their speakers. (If not, onboarding is too complex).
* **Speaker Submission Rate:** >70% of invited speakers must successfully submit their assets. (If not, the portal UX is failing).
* **Core Value Metric:** "Number of Support Tickets Saved." The primary ROI for a customer is the hours of manual work saved. We must be able to demonstrate this.
* **Churn Rate:** <5% monthly churn for the subscription model. If it's higher, we immediately pivot to the "Event Packs" model.
* **Net Revenue Retention:** >100%. Our goal is to grow revenue from existing customers through upselling to higher tiers.

Its success hinges on executing a flawless, "pit of success" experience for both the event manager and the speaker, justifying its position as a premium, best-in-class solution.
